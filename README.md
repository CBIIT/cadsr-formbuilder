Welcome to the caDSR Form Builder Project!
=====================================

caDSR Form Builder allows users to leverage Common Data Element (CDE) metadata to create forms that replicate the content of Case Report Forms (CRFs).
These Forms can include complex behavior, such as repeating groups and skip patterns.

The caDSR Form Builder is developed in Java and requires Apache Ant for building.
