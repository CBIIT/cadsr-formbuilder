This utility is based on Form Builder 4.0.4 code.

Libraries were copied from software/formbuilder/lib. Except formbuilder.jar which is an artifact of the Form Builder build: software\formbuilder\deployment-artifacts\bin

Service configuration files were copied from software/formbuilder/src/web/services-config/ and modified. The way they are used is not tier-specific.

This was developed to run under Java 1.5 as a command-line utility.

Certificates must be installed to successfully access the Object Cart API.

The program gets all carts by name and needs a reasonable amount of memory to hold the list.

Expected ant build targets are "dist" (default) and "clean".

The build creates FormConverter.jar under the dist folder and copies required libraries to dist/lib.

First argument is the Form Builder URL for EJB use.
Second argument is the Object Cart API URL.
Third argument is "all" to convert all carts, "guest" to convert only the guest cart, or anything else to connect and run through the steps without changing anything.

example execution: java -Xmx512M -jar FormCartConverter.jar jnp://127.0.0.1:1099 https://objcart-dev.nci.nih.gov/objcart10/ guest
