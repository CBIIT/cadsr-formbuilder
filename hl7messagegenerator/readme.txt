Steps for running the test cases

* Go to the config/caadapter directory and run 
   ant dist
   
   This generates a caAdpater jar file to be included with eDCI message generator. The caAdapter 
   source code was downloaded from the ncicb web site.
   
* File locations for various files can be set in the build.properties file.

* The SCS File, MAP File and H3S file in cvs are example caadapter files and not the actual
  instrument files. A sample CSV file for example MAP file is also used to test the caAdapter
  transformation service. The final message generated by the software uses this sample file and
  it is currently hardcoded in the  software
  (See  gov.nih.nci.ncicb.cadsr.serviceimpl.GenerateMessageServiceImpl). 
  When the Instrument SCS, MAP and H3S file are ready
  they should be placed in the appropriate directories under config. and the actual csv file 
  should be passed to the caAdapter transformation service.
  
* From the main checkout directory run the various test targets. The junit test cases are defined
  against a particular form in the dev database 1B4FBBDD-9FD4-5F94-E044-0003BA0B1A09
  
  For example 
  
    ant testGenerateCSVFile
    
    
* See issues.txt file.
