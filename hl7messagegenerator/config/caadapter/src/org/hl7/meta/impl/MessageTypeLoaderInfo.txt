Meta Classes and members to be populated by messageTypeLoader.
Peter Hendler
A list of what has to be done to load a MessageType by a loader with some unresolved questions.

Useful for implementing any type of MessageTypeLoader that will use Skirmantas original meta classes.

Would like a way to link these members to specific places in the MIF file.
Perhaps a sample MIF file, with annotations next to the values saying where they go in the metaClasses
described below.  If each slot here has a symbol we could just put the symbol next to the place in the
MIF file where you find the value.  I'll start each symbol with an astrix.

With this info, I could write the xPath queries to get the values to populate the meta classes.

MessageType  Loader will do these
